            <p>   Though there are 56 ethnic groups in China with extremely different religions and customs, we still consider ourselves as people from a united Chinese culture, facing up to the western mainstream society. Living in a society with rigid protection of diversity, I never realize the severe problem of cultural appropriation until the appearance of surreal oriental images conveyed by European and American artists, filmmakers and producers. Studying alone abroad and receiving directly the news from foreign media confirm my initial suspicions that the absurd way Chinese culture is shown has dramatically distorted the images in people’s mind. </p>
<hr>
<p>​    First of all, the appropriation of another culture should be considered as theft, though it is hard to be seen as theft in action. This is like sneaking in a neighbor’s house and wearing his personal shirt without permission because despite being shared and being spread, a culture belongs, after all, to a specific group and it should not be used out of context by someone outside the circle. It is not a double standard that Lil Dicky is not allowed to use N-word until he changes his body with Chris Brown in his song Freaky Friday [^1], that Katy Perry was fully criticized when she was dressed up as a geisha during the 2013 American Music Awards [^2] and that Arielle Haspel set off a fierce firestorm on social media by promoting “healthified” American Chinese restaurant [^3].  Being careless about culture ruins a relationship and ultimately shatters trust.</p>
<hr>
<p>​    Secondly, in terms of cultural appropriation, it is often inappropriately replaced or compared with some reactionary dichotomy like free speech v.s. censorship, which does not effectively help proceed a deep conversation but only inversely introduce distractions. People always demand permissions with high enthusiasm out of “artistic freedom” but they never try hard enough to understand another culture thoroughly because of their original stand. If there are people unfortunately on the margins, maybe we should think about how to bring them toward the center rather than taking the platform we already have and imagining what it is like on the margins. The elevation of the marginalized voices is the actual inclusion while on the other hand, the self-satisfactory imagination in the center is, in fact, a severe appropriation. Besides, even if it is free to imagine another world that they do not belong to, this does not mean that any art should be created without critique. People are supposed to prepare being scrutinized even before using a foreign culture because there will always be someone in the culture that they make reference to and he is capable of explaining his culture more precisely with his own experience. However, every time someone steps out and points out an impropriety, instead, they always try to react so defensively and denounce back by accusing others of double standards.</p>
<hr>
<p>​    What’s more, African American people and indigenous communities like Anishinaabe have suffered millions of Sundays of oppression along with the history of the United States. We have to acknowledge that the appropriation is completely institutionalized in the US, not just cultural appropriation, but also the appropriation of lands and lives, which have laid the foundation to the society of US and continues to influence the next generation. This is why white artists take the indigenous and exotic elements for granted and this is what the white privilege is talking about. In fact, people have already made tons of profits from the civil oppression and by silencing the marginalized voices so we have to accomplish serious and white-normative work, which involves reconciliation, to make sure our voices could be loud enough to be heard one day. And now, it seems like these people pretend to appreciate but actually desire to steal our culture only to pay lip services in order to sell CDs and get clicks. </p>

<p>​    In addition, they always manage to find themselves a conflation of fancy terms to win a rhetorical argument. In 2017, journalists from some of Canada’s largest media organizations supported the satirical “appropriation prize”, suggesting white writers explore others’ lives which do not belong to them [^4]. Fortunately, despite the traditional media woefully lacking minimal inclusion and ill-prepared to have actual debates with right representatives at highest levels, we no longer have to occupy chairs in mainstream news to have our voices heard because of social media and other ways. However, the new and crucial reality is that we have to change the culture that creates the opinions of continued appropriation and oppression on our land.</p>
<hr>
<p>​    To keep the wheel turning around, cultural appropriation originates, unfortunately, in my opinion, from the long-term social segregation since the colonization instead of an unrealistic harmonious integration, and it evolves into a new level of complicated formalism that people actually do not care a different idea and reluctantly pay a perfunctory effort to respect. I come from the Han Nationality, which is the largest ethnic group among 56. In fact, the huge Han population is, however, the result of the intermingling of many nationalities over a long time. Due to the small population and lack of resources, national minorities are nowadays offered some practical privileges and largely encouraged to educate themselves and find jobs in east-coast metropolises. If people stop considering themselves superior to others and start to pave the way for inclusion, cultures will combine and prosper. This is the power uniting all the pieces and constructing bridges of communication for us.</p>
<hr>
<p>​     Last but not least, representations matter. When connections are made to culture, we see people automatically as a full-fledged 3D humans rather than a representation of any group. To properly illustrate a specific culture, an ambassador inside the group is clearly needed to represent the right images and voices. A white singer dressed like a geisha can probably only gives people, who know little about Japanese culture, a stunning and impressive show of splendid tricks, while the singer is much likely to degrade the essential value of the culture and ignite by accident or on purpose the outburst of the people inside the circle because of the irreparable collateral damages done to the community. To take a step further, even if people hire the proper ambassador as a safe card, they are supposed to fully understand the exact culture they are operating and arrive at the core directly without their rough deduction. Like always, western luxury brands make few efforts on Chinese culture but they are strangely delighted to add Chinese elements to their prohibitive products at an inflated price. The typical western comprehension, full of stereotypes, of Chinese Lunar New Year, could be perfectly revealed by a series of union pictures from Burberry [^5] or the ad campaign from Dolce &amp; Gabbana [^6]. Again, formalism is not helpful. Instead, the second people abandon their stereotypes cast by their media is the exact moment they prepare themselves to embrace a real foreign culture.</p>
<hr>
<p>​    In conclusion, though the French classmates from the English course tried so hard, on the day of the presentation of the cultural appropriation in Hip-hop music and American society, to convince me that it is appropriate for me, as a matter of fact, to open a themed restaurant, offering French main courses and desserts, I still hold a firm attitude that our identities have already constructed several barrels as a social etiquette that we are not encouraged to cross through, and meanwhile others should not break in out of sudden without achieving a certain level of deep comprehension of our cultures, either. I could fully understand that people sometimes wear exotic objects out of curiosity or for fun, with no intention to hurt anyone else’s feeling, but sadly it does indeed. </p>
<hr>
<p>​    If we come back to the Hip-hop music, African American people put their life experiences of oppression and the desperate feelings, where they had to choose either to watch their children starving or to sell drugs on the streets to support the family, into the music, as a documentary legacy passed from generation to generation and a reminder of the history. On the other hand, a white face in Hip-hop industry might arouse potential controversy, who has never gone through all the tragedies and miserable memories because of his white privilege, living a fourth-generation in Concord, ice-skating on Walden Pond, lacrosse in the spring, from Hotchkiss to Yale. It sounds unfair, but the truth is that when an improper representative is seen for the first time, skepticism comes first, but not the content itself anymore, especially in a country where appropriation is institutionalized. A tiny controversy could be a deadly weakness to a fabulous masterpiece. We should be aware that the issues will repeatedly come over and over again and I strongly hope that those who are already in the center should start to listen and deeply consider their actions that our descendants will discuss and remember, in millennia from now. So please stop wearing others’ shirts unless permissions are granted.</p>

            <p>This post presents a method to create custom API endpoints in WordPress REST API (V2). </p>
<h2 id="WordPress-REST-API"><a href="#WordPress-REST-API" class="headerlink" title="WordPress REST API"></a>WordPress REST API</h2><p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress REST API</a> provides API endpoints for WordPress data types that allow developers to interact with sites remotely by sending and receiving JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. When you send content to or make a request to the API, the response will be returned in JSON. This enables developers to create, read and update WordPress content from client-side JavaScript or from external applications, even those written in languages beyond PHP. There are several default key words like <code>posts</code>, <code>users</code>, <code>comments</code> and so on. To use one of these key words, we would just for example make a <code>GET</code> request to <code>https://example.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts</code>. We would get a JSON response showing us all the posts of our website.</p>
<h2 id="Adding-Custom-Endpoints"><a href="#Adding-Custom-Endpoints" class="headerlink" title="Adding Custom Endpoints"></a>Adding Custom Endpoints</h2><p>The WordPress REST API is more than just a set of default routes. It is also a tool for creating custom routes and endpoints.</p>
<p>Though <a href="https://v2.wp-api.org/extending/adding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the official document</a> is very detailed, I still have some problems understanding the basic usage because I’m not so familiar with the <code>PHP</code> language and some concepts are abstract. On one hand, I didn’t know where to insert this part of code, while on the other hand, I didn’t what kind of code works to satisfy my needs. I didn’t fully understand how to add a custom endpoint until I finally found <a href="https://www.tychesoftwares.com/creating-custom-api-endpoints-in-the-wordpress-rest-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the blog of <em>Pinal Shah</em></a>, demonstrating several examples with full explanations. When I look back to the official document after having tried several examples of <em>Pinal Shah</em>, I start to understand what the official document really want to express. Still I have to say the official document is very detailed and it contains almost everything. If you don’t understand it at the first time just like me, don’t worry. Some examples can help you better understand.</p>
<h2 id="Example-API-for-mobile-applications"><a href="#Example-API-for-mobile-applications" class="headerlink" title="Example - API for mobile applications"></a>Example - API for mobile applications</h2><p>What I want to do is quite simple. I hava a website on WordPress including a tool for OCR (Optical Charactor Recognization). A client could upload an image or a document like <code>pdf</code>, and then he would get the recognized text from the image. Instead of sending back the raw text from the detection, the tool would apply <code>Regex</code> to extract useful information. Let’s say if a client could upload a electricity bill, the tool could help the client find his subscribing price, services fees… </p>
<p>Anyway, our mobile applications also want to integrate this tool, but we kind of don’t want to write this tool for another version of <code>Android</code> and <code>IOS</code>. It seems that writing a custom API could be the best solution and if we want to add new features to the tool, we would only have to modify the tool on the website.</p>

<p><code>register_rest_route</code> is the function that we need to use to register a new route with WordPress. This function needs to be added in a function attached to the <code>rest_api_init</code> hook.</p>
<p>The first argument in the <code>register_rest_route</code> function is the <strong>namespace</strong>. This namespace helps us to group together all our routes.</p>
<p>It is extremely important to add namespaces to your routes. The “core” endpoints use the <code>wp/v2</code> namespace. The first part of the namespace is <code>wp</code>, which represents the vendor name; <code>WordPress</code> and <code>v2</code> is the version number. In my example, I used <code>my-route</code> as <strong>namespace</strong>.</p>
<p>The second argument is the <strong>resource path</strong>. The resource path signifies what resource the endpoint is associated with (like posts, comments and so on). In our case, we will name it <code>pepper</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>&#39;/(?P&lt;type&gt;[^/]+)/(?P&lt;id&gt;[\d]+)/(?P&lt;ext&gt;[^/]+)&#39;</code> after <code>&#39;pepper&#39;</code> indicates three parameters passed by the url. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>&#39;?P&#39;</code> means here goes a parameter. <code>&#39;&lt;type&gt;&#39;</code> means this parameter is named as <em>type</em>. And <code>&#39;[^/]+&#39;</code> is the regular expression searching for any string containing no <code>&#39;/&#39;</code>. <code>&#39;[\d]+&#39;</code> means a string of numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The third argument is an array of options. Here we specify what methods the endpoint can use and callback functions for each method. This argument also allows us to provide a permissions callback, which can restrict access for the endpoint to certain users.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>&#39;validate_callback&#39;</code> is used to pass a function that will be passed the value of the argument. That function should return true if the value is valid, and false if not.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><code>&#39;sanitize_callback&#39;</code> is used to pass a function that is used to sanitize the value of the argument before passing it to the main callback.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using <code>sanitize_callback</code> and <code>validate_callback</code> allows the main callback to act only to process the request, and prepare data to be returned using the <code>WP_REST_Response</code> class. By using these two callbacks, you will be able to safely assume your inputs are valid and safe when processing.</p>
<p>Once this endpoint is created, you can access it at the below url <code>https://mysite.com/wp-json/my-route/pepper/images/1/jpeg</code></p>
<p>The function <code>custom_phrase</code> will return the response to the client. We could have access to the passed parameters by calling <code>$data[&#39;type&#39;]</code>.</p>
<p>In this example, I’ve defined 3 parameters. <code>type</code> indicates wether it’s <code>pdf</code> or <code>images</code>. <code>id</code> indicates the name of the file. And <code>ext</code> indicates the extension of the file.</p>
<h3 id="Use-the-Custom-Endpoint"><a href="#Use-the-Custom-Endpoint" class="headerlink" title="Use the Custom Endpoint"></a>Use the Custom Endpoint</h3><p>On the mobile phone, there’s nothing difficult to use the tool of the website.</p>

            <p>This is my first post on the website</p>
<h2 id="Preface"><a href="#Preface" class="headerlink" title="Preface"></a>Preface</h2><p>I’ve been constructing this website for about two weeks. This post should have been written long time ago. Finally, I got the time to write something about me. I am studying in <strong>Télécom ParisTech</strong> and it will still take me 1 year. After leaving Paris, I will come back to <strong>Shanghai Jiaotong University</strong> for another 1 year and a half and obtain my Master Degree. This summer, I am doing an internship at a start-up in Paris.</p>
<h2 id="Station-F"><a href="#Station-F" class="headerlink" title="Station F"></a>Station F</h2><p><strong>Station F</strong> is is a business incubator for startups, located in 13th arrondissement of Paris. Noted as the world’s largest startup facility.</p>

<p>Situated in a former rail freight depot previously known as la Halle Freyssinet (thereof the “F” in Station F). The 34,000 $$m^2$$ facility was formally opened by President Emmanuel Macron in June 2017 and provides office accommodation for up to 1,000 start-up and early stage businesses as well as for corporate partners such as Facebook, Microsoft and Naver.</p>
<h2 id="Wonest"><a href="#Wonest" class="headerlink" title="Wonest"></a>Wonest</h2><p>My internship is in a start-up named <a href="https://www.wonest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wonest</a>. It was established in Paris in 2017 and financed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bpifrance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BPI France</a>. The start-up offers a solution of the smart home. Typically, Wonest sells the products like smart plugs, smart bulbs. One of my senior schoolmates works also in this start-up. He’s developping the relative Android application. </p>
<p>In fact, it was he that had recommanded me to work with him. Well, this was a long story. This summer, the school demanded us to do an internship of at least a month (any kind of). Since I don’t want to waste my time doing something like manual labor (a bartender, an attendant in a restaurant, a worker in a farm…), I really want to do an internship related to my major. While it is hard to find such an internship in France with at most 2 months. Finally, I end up with Wonest. </p>
<p>In Wonest, I work as a front-end development engineer. Wonest offers a service to Chinese people in France. It helps them easily subscribe electricity and natural gas, and if the service price of the current energy provider is high, it also helps them to change the energy provider. This service is called <a href="https://yuezu.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yuezu</a> and I am developping the website for it. People can upload their energy bills, and then the website would analyze the uploaded file with the help of OCR technology provided by <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Cloud Vision</a>. With the detected text, the website would try to find all the clients’ information and most importantly, it would compare the clients’ electricity or gas price with the current prices of other energy providers. The principle is to encourage clients to change the energy provider because Wonest has a working relationship with several energy providers.</p>
