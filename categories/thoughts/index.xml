      <description>Though there are 56 ethnic groups in China with extremely different religions and customs, we still consider ourselves as people from a united Chinese culture, facing up to the western mainstream society. Living in a society with rigid protection of diversity, I never realize the severe problem of cultural appropriation until the appearance of surreal oriental images conveyed by European and American artists, filmmakers and producers. Studying alone abroad and receiving directly the news from foreign media confirm my initial suspicions that the absurd way Chinese culture is shown has dramatically distorted the images in people&amp;rsquo;s mind.</description>

      <description>This is my first post on the website
Preface I&amp;rsquo;ve been constructing this website for about two weeks. This post should have been written long time ago. Finally, I got the time to write something about me. I am studying in Télécom ParisTech and it will still take me 1 year. After leaving Paris, I will come back to Shanghai Jiaotong University for another 1 year and a half and obtain my Master Degree.</description>
