          <p>This is my first post on the website</p>
<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been constructing this website for about two weeks. This post should have been written long time ago. Finally, I got the time to write something about me. I am studying in <strong>Télécom ParisTech</strong> and it will still take me 1 year. After leaving Paris, I will come back to <strong>Shanghai Jiaotong University</strong> for another 1 year and a half and obtain my Master Degree. This summer, I am doing an internship at a start-up in Paris.</p>
<h2 id="station-f">Station F</h2>
<p><strong>Station F</strong> is is a business incubator for startups, located in 13th arrondissement of Paris. Noted as the world&rsquo;s largest startup facility.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Situated in a former rail freight depot previously known as la Halle Freyssinet (thereof the &ldquo;F&rdquo; in Station F). The 34,000 $$m^2$$ facility was formally opened by President Emmanuel Macron in June 2017 and provides office accommodation for up to 1,000 start-up and early stage businesses as well as for corporate partners such as Facebook, Microsoft and Naver.</p>
<h2 id="wonest">Wonest</h2>
<p>My internship is in a start-up named <a href="https://www.wonest.com/">Wonest</a>. It was established in Paris in 2017 and financed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bpifrance">BPI France</a>. The start-up offers a solution of the smart home. Typically, Wonest sells the products like smart plugs, smart bulbs. One of my senior schoolmates works also in this start-up. He&rsquo;s developping the relative Android application.</p>
<p>In fact, it was he that had recommanded me to work with him. Well, this was a long story. This summer, the school demanded us to do an internship of at least a month (any kind of). Since I don&rsquo;t want to waste my time doing something like manual labor (a bartender, an attendant in a restaurant, a worker in a farm&hellip;), I really want to do an internship related to my major. While it is hard to find such an internship in France with at most 2 months. Finally, I end up with Wonest.</p>
<p>In Wonest, I work as a front-end development engineer. Wonest offers a service to Chinese people in France. It helps them easily subscribe electricity and natural gas, and if the service price of the current energy provider is high, it also helps them to change the energy provider. This service is called <a href="https://yuezu.fr/">Yuezu</a> and I am developping the website for it. People can upload their energy bills, and then the website would analyze the uploaded file with the help of OCR technology provided by <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/">Google Cloud Vision</a>. With the detected text, the website would try to find all the clients&rsquo; information and most importantly, it would compare the clients&rsquo; electricity or gas price with the current prices of other energy providers. The principle is to encourage clients to change the energy provider because Wonest has a working relationship with several energy providers.</p>
