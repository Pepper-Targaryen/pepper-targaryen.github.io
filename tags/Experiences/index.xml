      <description>This is my first post on the website
Preface I&amp;rsquo;ve been constructing this website for about two weeks. This post should have been written long time ago. Finally, I got the time to write something about me. I am studying in Télécom ParisTech and it will still take me 1 year. After leaving Paris, I will come back to Shanghai Jiaotong University for another 1 year and a half and obtain my Master Degree.</description>
